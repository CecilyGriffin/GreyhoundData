# GreyhoundData
I have a retired racing greyhound named Astra. All racers have identifying tattoos in their ears that allow you to search for things like littermates, race statistics, and the pedigree of a dog. With some free time, I pulled Astra's racing statistics that were found on Greyhound Data (http://www.greyhound-data.com) and plotted them using Python Pandas and MatplotLib.
